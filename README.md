## 🎯 Overview

PestInPeace is an intelligent pest detection system that leverages Raspberry Pi computing power and various IoT sensors to monitor and detect pest activity in real-time. The system processes sensor data and triggers appropriate responses to manage pest populations effectively.

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-Sensor Support**: Integrates with various sensors including the LTR559 light and proximity sensor
- **IoT Connectivity**: Full IoT application support for remote monitoring and control
- **Periodic Monitoring**: Continuous periodic capture of sensor data
- **Real-time Processing**: Fast C++ implementation for low-latency pest detection
- **Modular Architecture**: Separate applications for different detection and monitoring tasks

## 🔧 Hardware Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi** (3 or later recommended)
- **LTR559 Light and Proximity Sensor**
- **Additional I/O sensors** (as configured in applications)
- **Power supply** (appropriate for your Raspberry Pi model)
- **Optional**: Network connectivity for IoT features

## 💻 Software Requirements

- **C++** (C++11 or later)
- **Make** build system
- **Raspberry Pi OS** or compatible Linux distribution
- Appropriate sensor libraries and GPIO libraries

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RickyzZ1/PestInPeace_rashberrypi.git
   cd PestInPeace_rashberrypi
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (adjust based on your specific sensor libraries):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
   ```

## 🔨 Building

Build the project using Make:

```bash
make
```

This will compile all applications and generate the necessary binaries.

To clean build artifacts:
```bash
make clean
```

## 📖 Usage

### Main Application
```bash
./app
```

### IoT Application
```bash
./iot_app
```

If your device permissions require elevated access:
```bash
sudo ./iot_app
```

### LTR559 Sensor Integration
```bash
./ltr559_iot
```

### Periodic Capture Utility
```bash
./periodic_capture
```

## 🔄 Update GitHub

After changing code locally, use this standard workflow:

```bash
cd /home/fiveguys/project/PestInPeace_rashberrypi-main
git status
git add -A
git commit -m "describe what changed"
git push origin main
```

Command meaning:

- `git status`: Check changed files before commit
- `git add -A`: Stage all changes (new/modified/deleted)
- `git commit -m "..."`: Create a local snapshot with a message
- `git push origin main`: Upload commits to GitHub `main` branch

If you only want to commit specific files:

```bash
git add src/main.cpp src/bme280.cpp
git commit -m "update sensor logic"
git push origin main
```

## 🔌 Project Components
